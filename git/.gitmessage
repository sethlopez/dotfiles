# • Think of the commit subject as an email subject (sometimes it is) #
# • Try to keep the subject around 50 characters at most              #
# • The subject should be sentence-cased                              #
# • Do not use a period at the end of the subject                     #
# • Separate the subject and body with a blank line                   #
# • Use the body to go into depth and explain why rather than how     #
# • Wrap the body at 72 characters                                    #
